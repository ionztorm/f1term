# Term

## Overview

### Planned Features

1. Formula 1 history
2. Formula 1 Driver statistics
3. Live race data

### Justification

While this information is available online, I want to be able to pull up the data during races as I watch, without having to load up a browser.

The goal of this project is to create a terminal based application that allows me to quickly pull up all of the information above.

As part of the [Boot.dev](https://boot.dev) syllabus, it is suggested, at the end of the Python path, that I create a personal project, and this is my choice of topic.

### Stack

To create this project, I will use:

- **Helix Editor**: I like this editor because it's _blazingly fast_, comes with sane defaults, and has all the tools I usually install and configure in neovim, but without the hastle of having to configure each feature at the risk of them not cooperating with eachother or breaking after updates. Hot take: I also does not support AI, which I find to be detrimental to learning. The temptation to use it, therefore, cannot be satiated.
- **Python**: Python is the languge used in the course leading up to this point, so it makes sense to write the project using this language.
- **Open F1 API**: This is a free and open-source API that provides all the information I am looking for. [Check it out](https://openf1.org)

### Future

The second half of the syllabus focuses on Golang. In the future, I plan to rebuild this project using Go.
